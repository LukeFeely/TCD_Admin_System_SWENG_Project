                    Dissertation is excellently
                    written, coherent,
                    internally consistent, well
                    organized and
                    exceptionally argued. The
                    report adheres throughout
                    to academic conventions
                    with respect to formatting
                    and referencing and is
                    carefully and effectively
                    presented. Excellent use of
                    figures, tables, and
                    diagrams where
                    appropriate.

                    The dissertation is
                    coherent, internally
                    consistent, well
                    organized and
                    lucidly argued.
                    Generally adheres
                    to academic
                    conventions and is
                    overall carefully
                    and effectively
                    presented. Suitable
                    use of figures,
                    diagrams, and
                    tables is made.

                    Dissertation
                    presents
                    incomplete and
                    flawed
                    explanations,
                    evidence and
                    argumentation.
                    Writing is of a
                    poor standard. Has
                    a lack of internal
                    consistency.
                    Makes insufficient
                    or incorrect use of
                    figures, diagrams,
                    and tables.
