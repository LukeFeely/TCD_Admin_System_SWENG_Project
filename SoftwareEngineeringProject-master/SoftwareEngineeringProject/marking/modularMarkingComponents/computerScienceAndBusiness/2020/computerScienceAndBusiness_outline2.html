            Work of high quality,
            thorough review of the
            literature demonstrating
            extensive knowledge of
            past/current work/authors
            in the field. Critical and
            analytical perspective,
            data collection &
            analysis. Exceptional
            ability to relate theoretical
            knowledge to project
            work.

            Work of good quality,
            demonstrating a good
            knowledge of past/current
            work/authors in the field.
            Evidence of a depth of
            analysis and breadth of
            viewpoint reaching
            conclusions of critical and
            analytical perceptive insight at
            MSc level. Above average
            ability to relate theoretical
            knowledge to project work.

            Work of

            inadequate
            exploration
            on literature
            expected for
